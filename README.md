# Foundational Concepts

## Linear Regression from Scratch
Construction of a linear regression model for a dataset with any number of variables. In summary, this is based on the principals of least mean square as the loss function and calculation of the gradient through partial derivatives. The gradient step algorithm is then implemented to arrive at the minimum for the loss function.
